# hello-world
This is the 1st Repository I created! { [ ( I: Do remember, U are the 1st Repository.  So, I'll call U "The One R"(nickname as 'OR').]  [OR: Yes, father! I shall never forget it. And I will let it be my epitaph: "OR, father's the 1st Repository who retired here.) ] }

Who's the lucky dog?
The 1st one who see this file, I have a gift for you:
Come on, OR! Give him\her\it a hug, and kiss the ear! Nibble now~. Yeah, that's wonderful.
"Father, salty."
Easy，OR. That's love.

I'm a novice of Python. Dont know other programming languages. Nice to meet you! ♂
